# Image Compression Using Modified JPEG Algorithm

## Project Overview

This project implements an image compression engine using an approach inspired by the JPEG algorithm, tailored to meet specific requirements. The system efficiently compresses grayscale images while maintaining a balance between image quality and compression ratio. The algorithm involves preprocessing the image, computing frequency components, quantization, and entropy encoding.

## Features

- Grayscale image compression
- Preprocessing of images to center pixel values
- Division of images into 8x8 blocks for localized processing
- Quantization of frequency coefficients
- Huffman encoding for lossless compression
